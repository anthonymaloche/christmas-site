<h1>Beer 1: Hoegarden</h1>
<h2>SCORE 86 Very Good</h2>
<p><em>Notes:</em> The Original Belgian Wheat Beer. Almost 600 years ago in the Belgian village of Hoegaarden, a band of monks experimented by adding oddball botanicals from halfway around the world to their traditional wheat beer. Our recipe, inspired by their creation, is a beer with a refreshing flavor and captivating aroma, unlike any in the world. Let the refreshing citrus and earthy coriander alleviate the stresses of modern living and whisk you to another place entirely. You might call it divine inspiration... we call it Hoegaarden.</p>
<h1>Beer 2: Allagash</h1>
<h2>SCORE 93 Outstanding</h2>
<p><em>Notes:</em> Our interpretation of a traditional Belgian wheat beer. Brewed with a generous portion of wheat and spiced with coriander and Curacao orange peel, this beer is fruity, refreshing and slightly cloudy in appearance.</p>
<h1>Beer 3: Namaste</h1>
<h2>SCORE 85 Very Good</h2>
<p><em>Notes:</em> A witbier bursting with good karma. Made with dried organic orange slices, fresh-cut lemongrass and a bit of coriander, this Belgian-style white beer is a great thirst quencher.</p>
<h1>Beer 4: Anchor Steam Christmas Ale</h1>
<h2>SCORE 88 Very Good</h2>
<p><em>Notes:</em> This is the forty-seventh Our Special Ale from the brewers at Anchor. This ale, made with natural flavors, features a new recipe &amp; tree every year, but the intent with which we offer it is the same:joy &amp; celebration of the newness of life. Trees symbolize the winter solstice when the earth, with its seasons, appears born anew, the natural beauty of the California high desert is epitomized by the western Joshua tree. Threatened primarily by climate change, it is a candidate for the protection under the California Endangered Species Act. </p>
